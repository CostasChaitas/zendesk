Zendesk:

This example project shows some ways we can manage the Zendesk tickets. For this project we created a Contact Form page where users can write a message and select the type of the message,
a script that is connected to a sample database and create or update Zendesk tickets based on some criteria and a Zendesk Help Center.

We have created some Views on the Zendesk dashboard like Orders, Urgent Orders, Contact, Help Center and each View will have only the respective tickets.
We have also created some Groups and there are some people who belong in each group.

The php script makes a connection to an sample db which includes some orders. The script loops through the database checks the 'status' field and foreach order that has a 'incomplete' status creates a zendesk ticket.
The script checks also the deadline and if its <14 create Urgent tickets.
If the status changes the script update the Zendesk ticket.

The Contact form has a dropdown menu where the user can select the type of the message like Order, Contact and the ticket will be shown in the specific View.
